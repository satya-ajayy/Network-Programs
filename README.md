# Python Network Programs

This repository contains a collection of network programs developed in Python using the `socket` module. These programs demonstrate various networking concepts, including client-server communication, data transmission, and more.

## Features

- **Client-Server Architecture**: Programs are built using a client-server model, allowing communication between multiple devices over a network.
- **Socket Programming**: The programs utilize Python's `socket` module to establish and manage network connections.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with major operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Prerequisites

To run these programs, you need:

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
- **Network Access**: Ensure that the machines involved are connected to the same network or can reach each other over the internet.

## Running the Programs

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajay-verse/Network-Programs.git
   cd Network-Programs
   ```
3. **Run the Server**:
First, run any server program to start server.
   ```bash
   python3 server_program.py
   ```
4. **Run the Client**:
On the same machine or a different one execute the client program to interact with server.
   ```bash
   python3 client_program.py
   ```
